    <h2>Care</h2>
    <p>Border Collies like Jade require regular exercise and mental stimulation to thrive. They are highly intelligent and need activities that challenge their minds, such as obedience training, agility courses, and interactive games. Additionally, they need plenty of space to run and play, so a large backyard or access to open areas is ideal.</p>
    <p>Proper socialization is also important for Border Collies to prevent behavioral issues. Early training and exposure to different environments and people will help them develop into well-rounded and confident dogs. Regular grooming, including brushing their coat and keeping their nails trimmed, is necessary to keep them looking and feeling their best.</p>
